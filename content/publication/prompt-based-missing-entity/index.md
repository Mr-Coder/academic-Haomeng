This paper addresses the challenge of missing entity recovery in arithmetic word problems using prompt-based techniques. The approach leverages natural language prompts to guide the system in identifying and recovering missing mathematical entities that are crucial for problem solving.

## Key Contributions

1. **Prompt-based Framework**: Novel use of prompts for entity recovery in mathematical problem solving
2. **Missing Entity Detection**: Systematic approach to identify missing entities in word problems
3. **Recovery Strategies**: Effective methods for reconstructing missing information
4. **Performance Improvement**: Enhanced accuracy in arithmetic word problem solving

## Methodology

The proposed approach includes:

- **Entity Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of entities in word problems
- **Missing Entity Identification**: Detection of implicit or missing entities
- **Prompt Design**: Crafting effective prompts for entity recovery
- **Recovery Process**: Systematic recovery of missing entities
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing problem solving systems

This work contributes to the advancement of automated mathematical problem solving by addressing a key challenge in natural language understanding for educational applications.
