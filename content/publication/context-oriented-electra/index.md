This paper introduces a context-oriented system that utilizes ELECTRA, a pre-trained language model, to enhance the understanding and solving of mathematical word problems. The system focuses on capturing contextual information to improve problem comprehension and solution accuracy.

## Key Contributions

1. **ELECTRA Integration**: Effective use of ELECTRA for mathematical problem understanding
2. **Context-Oriented Approach**: Emphasis on contextual information for better problem comprehension
3. **System Architecture**: Comprehensive system design for math word problem solving
4. **Performance Evaluation**: Thorough evaluation of the proposed approach

## Methodology

The proposed system includes:

- **Context Analysis**: Deep understanding of problem context using ELECTRA
- **Semantic Processing**: Enhanced semantic understanding of mathematical concepts
- **Problem Decomposition**: Breaking down complex problems into manageable components
- **Solution Generation**: Systematic approach to generating mathematical solutions
- **Evaluation Framework**: Comprehensive evaluation of system performance

This work demonstrates the effectiveness of transformer-based language models in educational applications, particularly in the domain of automated mathematical problem solving.
