## Project Overview

This project (2022-2023) is supported by the Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Incubation Program of Central China Normal University. It focuses on research into methods for solving algebraic word problems based on qualia structure and the integration of commonsense knowledge. The project aims to connect concepts and contexts by combining qualia structure with syntax-semantics models, expanding the application of machine solvers in intelligent tutoring systems.

## Research Background

Traditional neural solvers use end-to-end models to convert problem text into mathematical expressions, but lack the ability to extract quantitative relationships in complex scenarios. This project proposes a qualia role-based entity-dependency graph (EDG) to represent and extract quantity relations for solving Chinese algebraic word problems.

## Core Innovations

### 1. Qualia Structure Integration
- **Qualia Role Theory**: Applies qualia structure (formal, constitutive, telic, agentive roles) to analyze mathematical objects.
- **Concept-Context Connection**: Establishes semantic links between mathematical concepts and real-world contexts.
- **Commonsense Knowledge Fusion**: Effectively integrates commonsense knowledge into the problem-solving process.

### 2. Entity-Dependency Graph (EDG)
- **Graph Structure Representation**: Uses graph structures to represent dependency relations among mathematical objects.
- **Quantity Relation Extraction**: Extracts implicit quantity relations from qualia roles.
- **Algorithm Design**: Develops dedicated algorithms for EDG generation and quantity relation extraction.

### 3. Chinese Language Processing
- **Chinese-Specific Features**: Addresses unique linguistic features of Chinese algebraic word problems.
- **Language Understanding**: Enhances understanding of Chinese mathematical expressions.
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Considers the cultural context of Chinese mathematics education.
